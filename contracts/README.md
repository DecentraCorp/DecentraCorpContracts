# The DecentraCorp Contract Set

The DecentraCorp Contract set is written in solidity

These contracts are in a early beta-phase

The DecentraCorp Contract set is built from four seperate contracts starting with the DCBase contract.
The DCBase contract serves the purpose of housing all global variables and structs. From here the DCMember contract
 handles DecentraCorp Membership logic. After the Membership logic comes the newest contract which handles the
DecentraStock logic. Finally the contracts Round-out with the DecentraCorp contract which handles DecentraCorp
Voting logic.
