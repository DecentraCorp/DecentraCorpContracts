# The ChaosCasino Contracts

The ChaosCasino Smart-Contracts are written in solidity

These contracts are in a early beta-phase

The ChaosCasino contract handles the logic for ChaosCoin, the logic for game permissions
and the necessary logic for communicating with both the DecentraCorp and CryptoPatent contracts
as well as the logic for setting and retrieving the random numbers generated from ChaosMiners

The Entropy21 game contract handle the logic for interacting with the ChaosCasino/Entropy21 react based
front end as well as the logic for interacting with ChaosCoin/ the ChaosCasino
